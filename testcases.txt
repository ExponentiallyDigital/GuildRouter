1. No savedvariables file (first run):
delete any existing saved variables file
login
/run print("DB:", tostring(GuildRouterDB and GuildRouterDB.showLoginLogout), tostring(GuildRouterDB and GuildRouterDB.presenceMode), tostring(GuildRouterDB and GuildRouterDB.presenceTrace))
/run print("Globals:", tostring(GRShowLoginLogout), tostring(GRPresenceMode), tostring(GRPresenceTrace))
this output should be created
 DB: true guild-only
 Globals: true guild-only false
logout, file should be created as:

GuildRouterDB = {
["presenceMode"] = "guild-only",
["showLoginLogout"] = true,
["presenceTrace"] = false,
}

2. slash command produce expected outputs, test each option
    /grstatus - Show addon status
    /grpresence <off|guild-only|all> - Set presence mode
    /grpresence trace - Toggle presence trace
    /grforceroster - Force roster refresh
    /grreset - Recreate Guild tab
    /grfix - Repair message groups
    /grdelete - Delete Guild tab
    /grnames - Dump name cache
    /grtest - Simulate events <join, leave, promote, demote, note, ach>

3. check options set in UI/cmd line persist

    show login/out
    presenceMode    guild-only, all, off
    presenceTrace   shows debug info

    set each, are they still set correctly vis grstatus?
    1. login/out - true/false
    2. prsence mode change - guild-only, all, off
    3. trace mode change - true/false
=================

Bugs.
1. are guild member login/out messages still going into General as well as Guild?
if someone uses elvui their logon/off gets routed to General as well as Guild?

 Greydolly has come online. [Invite] <- in General AND Guild
 Nephiszel has come online. <- in Guild
 Khranuladir has gone offline. <- in Guild

2. quieten logon:
 GuildRouter: DBG:init assigned GRPresenceMode=guild-only GRPresenceTrace=false GRShowLoginLogout=true
